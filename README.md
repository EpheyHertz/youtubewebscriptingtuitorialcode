# FastAPI Web Scraping with Python - YouTube Tutorial

Welcome to the official repository for the **FastAPI Web Scraping with Python** YouTube tutorial! This project will guide you through creating an API that scrapes data from websites using the FastAPI framework and Python's web scraping libraries.

> **Watch the full tutorial on YouTube** to follow along with the code and explanations.

## 📖 Project Overview

In this tutorial, you’ll learn to build an API with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to perform web scraping tasks. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework that allows you to quickly build and deploy web applications and APIs. We’ll use it to create endpoints that trigger web scraping processes and fetch data from websites such as [PCWorld](https://www.pcworld.com/).

This repository contains all the code used in the tutorial, and the guide below will help you get set up and running.

### 🔗 Key Resources

## 🛠️ Features

- **API Endpoints**: Use FastAPI to define RESTful endpoints for web scraping tasks.
- **Web Scraping with Python**: Techniques to extract data using libraries like BeautifulSoup, requests, or Scrapy.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Leverage FastAPI’s async capabilities to improve the speed and performance of scraping operations.

   cd youtubewebscriptingtuitorialcode
### Install Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the FastAPI Server

To start the FastAPI server, use the following command:

    ```bash
    fastapi dev main.py

This will start the FastAPI server at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
### Example Usage

- **Access the root endpoint** to view the available API routes:

       ```arduino
       GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/
       GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
### Start a web scrapping task
      ```bash
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/scrape-newsarticles/

    ```bash
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/default/scrape_articles_scrape_newsarticles__get
